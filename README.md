# TechTerminologyAssist

In the world of public finance control and auditing, controllers often face challenges in understanding the technical terms within financial reports from various institutions. This difficulty arises from the fact that they may not have prior knowledge in specific technical domains. To address this issue, we have developed a dynamic web application called "TechTerminologyAssist." This application, upon uploading a file, extracts all technical terms from the document and displays detailed definitions sourced from a specialized dictionary.

## Features

- **File Upload**: You can upload PDF or Word files containing financial reports.
- **Extraction of Technical Terms**: Our machine learning model identifies relevant technical terms within the document.
- **Display Definitions**: Technical terms are associated with comprehensive definitions, making it easier to comprehend the report's content.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Your File**: Click the upload button and select the financial report file you want to analyze.

2. **Wait a Few Moments**: Our model will analyze the file and identify technical terms.

3. **Review Definitions**: Once the analysis is complete, you can review the technical terms and their associated definitions.

## Usage

- You can use this application to assist state controllers, auditors, and financial professionals in better understanding technical financial reports, even if they have no prior expertise in a specific domain.
- Definitions are extracted from a database of technical terms, ensuring a reliable source of information.
